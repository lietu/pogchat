# PogChat - Flash free Twitch chat

The purpose of this tool is to give streamers the ability to put the Twitch chat on any and all tablet, phone, Raspberry Pi, etc. and other devices that may not support Flash.

You will NOT be able to actively participate in the chat, and there is no way to moderate.

## Development

You will need to have Node.js and NPM installed.

To run the things, you probably need to do the following: 

```
npm install -g gulp
npm install
gulp
```

The first 2 lines install all the dependencies, and `gulp` compiles the TypeScript, SCSS, etc. and makes a build under `public/` that you can then distribute, open in your browser, or whatever.
